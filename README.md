The goal is to develop a sliding-window behavioral paradigm. I want to divide the story into six segments and recruit six nonoverlapping groups of 50 participants to predict every upcoming word within each segment of the story. The first group is exposed to the first two words in the story and then asked to predict the upcoming word. After entering their prediction, the actual next word is revealed, and participants are asked again to predict the next upcoming word in the story. Once ten words are displayed on the screen, the left-most word is removed and the next word is presented. The procedure is repeated, using a sliding window until the first group provides predictions for each word in the storyâ€™s first segment. Each of the other five groups listens uninterruptedly to the prior segments of the narrative and starts to predict the next word at the beginning of their assigned segments.
